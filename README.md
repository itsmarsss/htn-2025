## How to run

1. Ensure you have Python and Node installed
2. (recommended) create a virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv` and activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the backend with `python backend/webserver.py`
5. Run the following commands in a separate terminal to set up the frontend:
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm run dev`
6. Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`
7. Enjoy! (note: the AI agent is not currently configured to work properly, so a fallback mode is used instead)

A production version will be released soon.

## Inspiration

We've always been fascinated by the futuristic interfaces in movies like _Minority Report_ and _Iron Man_. Traditional 3D modeling software, while powerful, often has a steep learning curve and relies on clunky keyboard shortcuts and mouse clicks. We asked ourselves: what if we could sculpt 3D objects as naturally as if we were molding clay with our own hands? Our inspiration was to **bridge the gap between human intuition and digital creation**, building an accessible, immersive, and magical 3D modeling experience right in the browser. We wanted to create a tool that feels less like operating a machine and more like an extension of our own creativity.

## What it does

ShapeShift is an innovative, browser-based 3D modeling platform that transforms your webcam into a powerful creation tool. It allows users to interact with a 3D environment in two revolutionary ways:

-   **👋 Real-Time Gesture Control:** Using your hands, you can directly manipulate objects in the 3D scene. ShapeShift tracks your hand movements in real-time, allowing you to grab, move, rotate, and scale objects with intuitive gestures, eliminating the need for a mouse and keyboard.
-   **🤖 AI Agent Assistant:** ShapeShift features an intelligent AI assistant that understands natural language. You can simply tell the AI what you want to create or modify. For example, you can say, "Create a red sphere and a blue cube, then place the sphere on top of the cube," and the AI will execute the commands.
-   **✨ AI-Powered 3D Model Generation:** Stuck for ideas? You can describe a concept like "a futuristic spaceship" or "a stylized tree," and our integrated generative AI will create a detailed 3D model for you on the fly, ready to be imported and manipulated in your scene.

## How we built it

ShapeShift is built on a modern, multi-faceted tech stack designed for real-time performance and intelligence.

-   **Frontend:** The entire user interface is a dynamic web application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. For rendering the 3D environment, we used the powerful **Three.js** library, primarily through the declarative APIs of **@react-three/fiber** and **@react-three/drei**. Global state management is handled efficiently by **Zustand**.

-   **Backend (Computer Vision):** The gesture-control engine is powered by a **Python** backend using **Flask** and **Eventlet** for high-performance WebSocket communication. We use **OpenCV** to capture the video feed from the user's webcam and the **MediaPipe** library to perform real-time hand landmark detection. This landmark data is then streamed to the frontend.

-   **Backend (AI Agent):** The AI assistant is orchestrated by a **Node.js** server using **Express**. This server acts as a middleware that defines a set of tools (functions) the AI can use to manipulate the 3D scene. It integrates with LLM providers (like Martian) and the **Fal AI** API for generative 3D model creation from text prompts.

The components communicate seamlessly: the Python backend streams hand data to the React frontend via WebSockets, while the frontend sends user prompts to the Node.js server to trigger AI actions.

## Challenges we ran into

Building a project this ambitious came with its fair share of hurdles.

One of the biggest challenges was **minimizing latency**. For the gesture control to feel natural, the delay between a physical hand movement and the response in the 3D viewport had to be negligible. We spent a significant amount of time optimizing our Python backend, implementing frame-skipping logic and efficient data serialization to ensure the WebSocket connection remained snappy.

Another difficulty was designing a **robust gesture recognition system**. Raw hand landmark data from MediaPipe is noisy and varies between users. We had to develop normalization and rotation-invariant processing techniques to translate this raw data into consistent, reliable commands like "pinch" or "grab."

Finally, **integrating the three distinct parts** of our application (Python CV, Node.js AI, and React frontend) was a complex architectural task. Ensuring smooth communication and state synchronization between these services required careful planning and debugging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are incredibly proud of creating a **truly multi-modal interface** for 3D creation. The ability to seamlessly switch between direct, physical manipulation with your hands and high-level, abstract commands with your voice is the core of what we wanted to achieve.

The **low-latency performance** of the hand-tracking pipeline is a major accomplishment. It feels fluid and responsive, which is crucial for making the experience immersive rather than frustrating.

Furthermore, we developed a **comprehensive and powerful toolset for our AI agent**. The AI can do more than just create primitives; it can perform complex boolean operations, modify materials, duplicate objects, and even generate entirely new models, giving users immense creative leverage through simple language.

## What we learned

This project was a massive learning experience. We learned a great deal about the intricacies of **real-time computer vision** and the importance of performance optimization at every step of the data pipeline. We also gained a deep appreciation for the complexities of **human-computer interaction design**, especially when creating novel interfaces that don't rely on established conventions.

On the AI front, we learned how to effectively design and implement a **tool-using AI agent**. Defining clear, non-overlapping functions and engineering the system prompts to get reliable, structured output from the LLM was a fascinating challenge that pushed our understanding of applied AI.

## What's next for ShapeShift

The future is bright and three-dimensional! We have many ideas for where to take ShapeShift next:

-   **Expanded Gesture Library:** We plan to introduce more complex and two-handed gestures for advanced actions like scaling the entire scene, drawing custom shapes, or performing intricate sculpting operations.
-   **Multi-User Collaboration:** We want to turn ShapeShift into a collaborative space where multiple users can join a session and build together in real-time, seeing each other's virtual hands.
-   **AR/VR Integration:** The ultimate goal is to break free from the 2D screen entirely. We plan to adapt our interaction model for augmented and virtual reality headsets to create a fully immersive 3D modeling environment.
-   **Smarter AI:** We will continue to enhance our AI's capabilities, enabling it to understand more complex, multi-step commands and maintain a better contextual awareness of the user's project goals.
